UNF: DB(id,name,date_of_birth,lab_id,lab_name,research_id,research_desc,research_supervisor)

1NF: 
Research code, description and supervisor are repeating fields, 
Therefore they will be represented in seperate tables:

members (*id*, name, date_of_birth, lab_id, lab_name)
research (*id*, name, supervisor)

candidate keys are id in both tables

2NF:
lab_name is depended on lab_id and not on member id
therefore will be represented in a seperate table:

members(*id*, name, date_of_birth)
labs (*id*, name)
research (*id*, name, supervisor)

keys are id on all tables

3NF: 
There are no transitive dependencies, all non-prime attributes 
are depended entirily on the key and not on other non-prime attributes
Therefore 
3NF = 2NF
